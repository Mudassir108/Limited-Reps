## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Requirements

### 1. PayPal Business Account ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED

**Current Status:** Unknown (Must be verified by you)

**Required Steps:**
1. Log in to https://www.paypal.com
2. Verify account type is **Business** (not Personal)
3. Confirm email `mudassirshahid605@gmail.com` is verified
4. Enable **Website Payments Standard**:
   - Settings ‚Üí Payment Preferences
   - Turn on "Website Payments"
5. Verify no account limitations
6. Complete any required identity verification

**Why This Is Important:**
The error "Things don't appear to be working" is a PayPal account configuration issue, not a code issue. PayPal requires Business accounts with Website Payments enabled to accept payments via Buy Now buttons.

**Testing Recommendation:**
Use PayPal Sandbox (https://developer.paypal.com) for testing before going live. This allows you to test the entire payment flow without real money.

---

### 2. Email Credentials ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED

**Current Status:** Missing

**Required Configuration:**
Add to `.env.local` file:
```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USERNAME=mudassirshahid605@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
```

**How to Get Gmail App Password:**
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
3. Create App Password:
   - Select "Mail"
   - Select "Other" (name it "Limited Reps")
   - Click "Generate"
4. Copy the 16-character password
5. Add to `.env.local` (no spaces)

**Why This Is Important:**
Without email credentials, order notifications cannot be sent. You won't receive emails when customers place orders, which means you might miss sales.
